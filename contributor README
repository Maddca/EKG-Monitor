If you wish to contribute to this project there is only one main issue. If you have read the project writeup then you would know that 

the save preceding function does not work. The code for this function is in the switch for mode case 2 as well as a function at the bottom of the file.

There are also other file that could have some related code. The owner of this project believes the project may have to do with the itteration. 

This project was originally for an electrical engineering class so it is mostly inactive but it would be appreciated if anyone could fix this issue.
